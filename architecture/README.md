# Tooling

> This section provides a high level overview of the systems applicative tooling.

The following section describes the tool selected for the completion of the hackathon. These tools where selected because they all are capable of meeting the foundational truths of the protocol. In all cases, these tools aid in facilitating a tapestry within the network to ensure the free and open sharing of ideas. All systems are distributed in some form, and are completely replacabile should something better become available. Note that these tools, are focused on the backbone of our network and not the end products for consumers.


  * [Git](#git)
  * [Ethereum](#ethereum)
  * [uPort](#uport)
  * [Beaker](#beaker)
  * [Hashbase](#hashbase)
  * [IPFS](#ipfs)
  * [Web3](#web3)

## Git
Every asset produced, except the video (if it gets done), will be found within this repository on [Github](https://github.com/realrhys/Inter-Planetary-Sovereign-Identity-And-Trust-Protocol). It is assumed that the reader is familiar with Git, and as such,this document does not provide the details.

## Ethereum
All of the identities created for the hackathon will be stored on an [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) testnet and have a public address. Here is mine: 0x0Aff7163B456f6579266D9E4D9AF17c44b98E0C3

The advantage here is fairly straight forward. Its your data, you own it, on the blockchain. The tool used, detailed below, is simply a tool. Should at some point in the future,you wish to move to a different tool, you will be free to do so.

## uPort
[uPort](https://www.uport.me/) is a tool from [Consensys](https://new.consensys.net/) is a tool that creates and manages my identity on the blockchain. It handes access to my data as well as attestations of proof. To play with the software, you will first need to install the mobile application.

## Beaker
[Beaker](https://beakerbrowser.com/) is an open source browser built on top of [Electron](https://electronjs.org/). Beaker was chosen due to its many features such as peer-to-peer connectivity. Additionally, as the network grows, it is proposed that Beaker may be enhanced to support other usecases such as the potential for personal assisted AI integration.

## Hashbase
[Hashbase](https://electronjs.org/) is a service that allows for the online hosting of Beaker browser applications. We use Hashbase because, if others want to demo the efforts, they will be able to.

## IPFS
[Interplanetary Filesystem](https://ipfs.io/), the inspiration for the naming of our challenge, is a peer-to-peer, decentralized hypermedia protocol for the web. To see more mature use cases for IPFS simply go to [DTube](https://d.tube/) and [Steemit](https://steemit.com/).

## Web3
[Web3](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/getting-started.html) is a javascript API for working within the Etherium ecosystem.
